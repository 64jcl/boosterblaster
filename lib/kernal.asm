// The Commodore KERNAL (yes spelled with an A) is a ROM containing large portions of
// the equivalent of an operating system. It has IO management that can talk to disk
// drives, tape drives, printers and modems as well as reading from the keyboard and
// print to the screen. The ROM also contains the default vectors set up for a lot of
// features that are enabled when the machine is turned on so that you can start
// typing BASIC immediately after powerup. It sets up the IRQ so that it can scan
// the keyboard and echo letters onto the screen as well as trigger the BASIC parser
// when you press enter, and blinking a cursor.
//
// Most programs and games needs to focus on speed over versatility so they tend to
// bank out both BASIC and KERNAL ROMs after startup in order to gain access to the
// memory that sits behind it. But the KERNAL still contains some routines that
// can be used to simplify making some programs where you dont want to handle all
// the input/output yourself. It is common for many to still call the keyboard scan
// routines (even in games) to get the key that is being pressed, even though the
// ROM code have some bugs and is not particularly efficient.
//
// It is common to use the KERNAL for simple disk IO, although many choose to swap
// these out as well with fast loading routines since the Commodore 64 was released
// with very slow disk routines (due to timing troubles). Many use a fast loader
// cartridge which will simply replace the vectors used for disk io after installing a
// better loading routine into the drives memory (yes the disks are computers in themselves!).
