// The Zero page is the first page of 256 bytes in the machine and is an important
// piece of memory for the 6502 processor. The zero page is used frequently by 
// programs for both speed and to necessary for indirect indexed adressing.
// For example the instruction: lda ($fe),y
//
// Besides the two first addresses ($00 and $01) the whole of ZP is actually free for
// programs to use as they wish. But when the machine powers on, there are two
// ROMs that use almost every byte of it for their own routines, the BASIC ROM and
// the KERNAL ROM. So when the computer is "READY" after a boot, the ROMs both
// use the zero page a lot for absolutely anything you do on the screen editor,
// writing basic programs and all.
//
// Naturally for standalone assembly programs that do not need BASIC and even the
// KERNAL functions, you can turn these ROMs off and redirect interrupts to where
// you want them to go - effectively also enabling your program to also read RAM
// that is normally "shadowed" by the two ROMs. Writing to the addresses where
// these two ROMs are at will actually write to the RAM under them always, even
// when they are turned on, but you will not be able to read or jump to your own
// code residing in these areas unless you have turned off the ROMs. However as
// an interesting feature, the VIC-II graphics chip will always see RAM in these
// areas, making them ideal places for custom graphics if you still need to
// have BASIC/KERNAL turned on. There is an exception though and that is the
// CHARGEN ROM that contains the default character set. The VIC-II will always
// see these charsets on the address ranges $1000-$1FFF and $9000-$9FFF.
