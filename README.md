# Installation instructions

* Install Visual Studio Code

https://code.visualstudio.com/download

* Install Visual Studio Code
Open VS Code in the root folder of the repo with the . command:
```bash
code .
```

Install recommended extensions (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>, "Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions")
to install the [retro studio plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulhocker.kick-assembler-vscode-ext)
If you can not find the recommendations, try installing it from the link manually.

# Attempt at automating the install

This is not perfect, the installation steps can be a bit fiddly, but this does make it a little bit more explicit and it should work.
If it does not work as intended, or if your OS is not included, try the manual steps below.
You can also borrow from the script that looks the most like your OS.

## WSL2 on Windows
This setup should work with installing on Ubuntu in WSL2.
It is using the neat litle trick of WSL's ability to run Windows programs to launch VICe.

Install dependencies. If you hava Java, comment out the line that installs the JDK first. It should be minimum version 11.
```bash
./install_deps_linux.sh
```
Modify .vscode/settings.json file paths, these must be absolute so will have to refere to location of repository.
Java is likely in the path below.

```json
    "kickassembler.javaRuntime": " /usr/bin/java",
    "kickassembler.assembler.jar": "{PATH_TO_REPO}/tools/kickass/kickassembler-5.19.jar",
    "kickassembler.emulator.runtime": "{PATH_TO_REPO}/tools/vice/bin/x64sc.exe",
```
## Windows
Installing Java on Windows is a pain. Try installing from the msi file at 
https://docs.microsoft.com/nb-no/java/openjdk/download, such as https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-11.0.15-windows-x64.msi and install it.
Remember to tick all the boxes just to be sure.

Then install dependencies from powershell using
```powershell
./install_deps_windows.ps1
```

Modify .vscode/settings.json file paths, these must be absolute so will have to refere to location of repository.
```json
    // "kickassembler.javaRuntime": "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_201\\bin\\java.exe",
    "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\jdk-11.0.15.10-hotspot\\bin",
    "kickassembler.assembler.jar": "{PATH_TO_REPO}\\tools\\kickass\\kickassembler-5.19.jar",
    "kickassembler.emulator.runtime": "{PATH_TO_REPO}\\tools\\vice\\bin\\x64sc.exe"
```

## Manual steps
* Download KickAssembler and Vice (Windows) from https://www.badgerpunch.com/booster/

OR 

* Download KickAssembler from: http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler
   And unpack it in <boosterblaster-folder>/tools/kick/

* Download Vice emulator from: http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/
   For Windows users: Unpack it in the folder <boosterblaster-folder>/tools/vice/
   For OSX users: Install it. Check if 'x64sc' is in /usr/local/bin/
   If not, we need to link it up, from /usr/local/Celler/vice/<version>/x64sc

* Optional: Add the Kick Assembler extension by Paul Hocker to VSCode:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulhocker.kick-assembler-vscode-ext


* Download Java JRE/JDK or just adjust settings.json to point to your Java JRE bin folder

Alternatively create another location for your tools and modify settings.json to reflect where they are.

Press F5 to compile and run if you have set up the KickAssembler extension.
Otherwise run build.bat on Windows or osx-build.sh on Mac (both assume /tools/ folder is set up)

# Folder structure:
```
bin/         Binary output folder (not part of repo, but build will create main.prg here)
lib/         Library asm files
res/         Resources like charsets and sprites
design/      Design of charsets and sprites
docs/        Some helping documents for coding
examples/    A couple of 6502 code examples
assignments/ Solutions to the 4 assignments including full game
tools/       The folder you place your tools in to use the build scripts
   
main.asm     The actual game code but with 4 empty functions as assignments
```
