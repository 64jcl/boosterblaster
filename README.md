# Installation instructions

* Install Visual Studio Code

* Download KickAssembler and Vice (Windows) from https://www.badgerpunch.com/booster/

OR 

* Download KickAssembler from: http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler
   And unpack it in <boosterblaster-folder>/tools/kick/

* Download Vice emulator from: http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/
   For Windows users: Unpack it in the folder C:/Applications/Vice
   For OSX users: Install it. Check if 'x64sc' is in /usr/local/bin/
   If not, we need to link it up, from /usr/local/Celler/vice/<version>/x64sc

* Optional: Add the Kick Assembler extension by Paul Hocker to VSCode:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulhocker.kick-assembler-vscode-ext


* Download Java JRE/JDK or just adjust settings.json to point to your Java JRE bin folder

Alternatively create another location for your tools and modify settings.json to reflect where they are.

Press F5 to compile and run if you have set up the KickAssembler extension.
Otherwise run build.bat on Windows or osx-build.sh on Mac.
